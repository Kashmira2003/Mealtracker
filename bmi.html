      <h1>What is BMI?</h1>
      <p>
        Body Mass Index (BMI) is a numerical measure that relates an
        individual's weight to their height, providing a simple and quick
        screening tool to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight. BMI
        is widely used in both clinical and public health settings to categorize
        individuals into different weight status categories, helping to identify
        potential health risks associated with being underweight, normal weight,
        overweight, or obese.<br />
        The formula for calculating BMI is straightforward and involves dividing
        a person's weight in kilograms by the square of their height in meters.
        For those using pounds and inches, a slightly modified formula is
        employed, multiplying the weight in pounds by 703 before dividing by the
        square of the height in inches.<br />The World Health Organization (WHO)
        and many health agencies worldwide have established standard BMI
        categories based on extensive population studies. These categories
        include:<br /><b>1.Underweight (BMI less than 18.5):</b> Individuals
        falling into this category may face health risks associated with
        insufficient body weight. Underweight can be indicative of malnutrition,
        eating disorders, or other underlying health issues.<br /><b
          >2.Normal weight (BMI 18.5 to 24.9):</b
        >This range is considered healthy for most adults. People within this
        category generally have a lower risk of weight-related health
        problems.<br /><b>3.Overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9):</b>
        Individuals in this category have a higher amount of body fat than is
        considered healthy, which may increase the risk of various health
        conditions, including cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.
